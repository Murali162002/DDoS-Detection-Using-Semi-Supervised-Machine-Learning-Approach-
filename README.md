# DDoS Detection Using Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Approach

 Even though advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been adopted for DDoS detection, the attack remains a
 major threat of the Internet. Most of the existing ML-based DDoS detection approaches are under two categories: supervised
 and unsupervised. Supervised ML approaches for DDoS detection rely on availability of labeled network traffic datasets.
 Whereas, unsupervised ML approaches detect attacks by analyzing the incoming network traffic. Both approaches are
 challenged by large amount of network traffic data, low detection accuracy and high false positive rates. In this paper
 we present an online sequential semi-supervised ML approach for DDoS detection based on network Entropy estimation,
 Co-clustering, Information Gain Ratio and Exra-Trees algorithm. The unsupervised part of the approach allows to reduce
 the irrelevant normal traffic data for DDoS detection which allows to reduce false positive rates and increase accuracy.
 Whereas, the supervised part allows to reduce the false positive rates of the unsupervised part and to accurately classify the
 DDoS traffic.
